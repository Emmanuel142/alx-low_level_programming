A function pointer is a concept in programming languages like C and C++ that allows you to store the memory address of a function and later invoke the function through that pointer. It enables dynamic selection and execution of functions at runtime. Function pointers provide a way to treat functions as first-class citizens, allowing you to pass functions as arguments to other functions, return functions from functions, and store functions in data structures.
