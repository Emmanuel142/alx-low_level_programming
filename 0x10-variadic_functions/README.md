Variadic functions, also known as variadic functions or varargs functions, are functions in programming languages that allow you to pass a variable number of arguments to the function. In other words, you can call a variadic function with a different number of arguments each time you use it. This is particularly useful when you want to create functions that can handle different numbers of inputs or parameters.

In C and many other programming languages, variadic functions are typically used in situations where the number of arguments is not known at compile-time or can vary. The most common example of a variadic function in C is the printf function, which can take a variable number of arguments depending on the format string.

In C, variadic functions are declared using the stdarg.h library, and they involve the use of macros and functions like va_list, va_start, va_arg, and va_end to manipulate the variable argument list.
